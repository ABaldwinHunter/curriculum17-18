Foundations (Year 1)
===================
| Unit | Topic |# of Lessons | Objectives | 
|:--------:|:---:|:---:|:---------:|
| [**0**](units/unit0) | Routines and Introductions | 2 | This unit consists of icebreaker activities for students and teachers. This unit will also be most students' first interaction with HTML.|
| [**1**](units/unit1) | HTML: Content | 2 |In this unit students will be introduced to HTML. They will learn basic tag structure and will use the following tags `<head> <body> <p> <h1> <img> <a>`|
| [**2**](units/unit2) | CSS Tag Selectors | 2 |In this unit students will be taught how to manipulate the style of a webpage using basic CSS selectors.|
| [**3**](units/unit3) | HTML Lists, HTML IDs & Classes, `<div>` | 2 |In this unit students will first learn how to make ordered and unordered list. They will then utilize IDs and Classes to identify tags on a webpage. |
| [**4**](units/unit4)  | Positioning, Layout & Wireframing | 2 |In this unit students will learn to position elements on a page using CSS. Students will be introduced to the CSS box model. |
| [**5**](units/unit5) | jQuery: show/hide, events, inputs, .val() | 2 |In this unit students are introduced to jQuery. jQuery is used as a tool for creating interactive websites that react to user actions. |
| [**6**](units/unit6) | Cloud9, Git, Multi-Page Sites| 2 |In this unit students will be introduced to a new IDE called Cloud 9. They will then create a project using Cloud 9 and GitHub using skills they have already gained in previous units. |
| [**7**](units/unit7) | GitHub Collaboration | 2 |In this unit the class will collaborate on a project using GitHub and Cloud 9.|
| [**Review Unit**](units/unitReview) | Review unit | 2 |In this unit the students are given a mid-year challenge in HackerRank that tests all of the skills learned until this point. Teachers are then given the opportunity to have students create a project that requires the students to practice skills that require more attention before moving onto unit 8.
| [**8**](units/unit8) | JavaScript Introduction | 2 |In this unit the students are given a soft introduction to JavaScript. They will be making **Function** calls to manipulate content on a webpage.
| [**9**](units/unit9) | JavaScript: Value Types, Operators, Variables, & Conditionals| 2 | In this unit students are introduced to **Value Types, Operators, Variables, and Conditional Statements** by making two games that ask the user to guess a certain word or number.|
| [**10**](units/unit10) | JavaScript: Functions| 2 |In this unit students combine their knowledge of **Variables & Functions** to revisit Tiny Turtle to define their own functions. After this they will create new functions for mini-projects.|
| [**11**](units/unit11) | JavaScript: Math & Arrays| 2 |This unit kicks off with a game of Jeopardy. Then this unit introduces students to the JavaScript **Math library** in the form of a dice simulation game and grid painting game. After that they will be introduced to **Arrays**. |
| [**12**](units/unit12) | JavaScript: Animations and Collisions| 2 |In this unit students are introduced to the concept of game development as the begin to program simple **Animations & Collision Detections** using jQuery. |
| [**13**](units/unit13) | JavaScript: Looping| 2 |In this unit students will be introduced to **For Loops.** They will generate images rapidly on an HTML page and will then revisit Tiny Turtle to create fractal art programs. The students will then create a fully functional Hangman game.|
